      <h2>Kostuch Announces Deregulation of Herd Sizes</h2>
      <p>
        Minister of agriculture and industry, Olaf Kustuch, has announced the lessening of restrictions around herd sizes for outside farm animals. This legislation largely affects cattle and sheep, but also applies to goats, chickens, and pigs. In many cases, the maximum number of animals allowed per hectare is double or even triple of what it was before. This is the latest in a series of bills intending to deregulate the farming sector, as put forward in the <a href="url">'Freedom for Farmers' initiative.</a></p>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Farmers Federation, which represents a majority of farmers in Krawędź, has proclaimed it to be 'a great win for the small, independent farmers, who are given more freedom to feed the country.' They continued: 'This is a great boost for the agricultural sector specifically and the economy at large.'

        Environmental experts, meanwhile, are worried by potential increases in nitrates in ground water and river systems, if herd sizes do increase. They also warn of some potential loopholes, allowed for by the 56 page document. Specifically, they point out an extension to the Agricultural Innovation Program, where farmers can forgo herd size limits altogether if they can 'implement systems and best practices to mitigate the negative efffects of keeping a larger number of animals.' The document doesn't clarify what these 'systems' or 'best practices' entail.

        The environmental orginization Ziemasiła has already commited to sueing the government, as they've done with the previous 'Freedom for Farmers' bills. Yet it seems unlikely that the lawsuit will amount to meaningfull amendments. This bill was described as 'much more waterproof' by legal experts.
