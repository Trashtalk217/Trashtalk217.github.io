      <h2>Lowest Trust Government in Five Years, Poll says</h2>
      <p>
        Trust in government has reached a five year low, according to <a href="url">Krawędź Polling Arm</a>'s yearly political sentiment poll. This study, being undertaken only three months after the <a href="url">Krzysztof Kompromat Scandal</a>, saw a major loss in public trust in parliament in general, and the executive branch specifically. Trust in parliament saw a year-on-year decline of 17%, from the previous 52% to the current 35%. The executive branch took a 36% hit, going from 65% to a historical low of 29%. Demographically, the loss in confidence is almost universal across the different age brackets. Even among the older generations, who are often less politically engaged, a major decline was measured.

        When asked for clarification, most surveyed said that the Krzysztof Kompromat Scandal was the largest reason for disagreeing with the statement 'I trust the national government to solve national problems'. Others have noted the muddled communication regarding <a href="url">Glina's unexpected bid for the Olympics</a>, almost a year ago. Senior citizens were more likely to cite the Tyrania Szeptów, often adding that such a comparison should be taken with a grain of salt.

        Other governmental institutions have not suffered the large confidence loss that was suffered by our national government. The public schools, the police force, and other social services were largely unaffected by the political scandal. The legislative branch even saw an 7% rebound after the controversial 2018 <a href="url">'Right to Parent' hight court ruling</a>. Other notable developments include a slight decrease in local government trust, mainly attributed by participants to unequal treatment, petty corruption and general ineffectiveness. Also, firefighters have achieved a higher then 95% approval rating for the fifth year of this fiver year-running poll.
