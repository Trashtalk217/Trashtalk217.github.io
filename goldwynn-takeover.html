      <h2>Goldwynn Media Acquires Krawędź News After Negotiations</h2>
      <p>
        [21-08-2019] Goldwynn Media had been publicly entertaining the idea to formally acquire Krawędź News for a couple months now. The concern has, however, experienced significant push-back from both employees of Krawędź and vocal supporters of the newspaper, stating that this move will undermine independent journalism. A Goldwynn spokesperson has in response promised the continued integrity, in the case of an acquisition.

        Despite these concerns, Goldwynn Media and Krawędź have put out a press release earlier today, announcing an acquisition in which Goldwynn Media would subsume all assets and debts of Krawędź News. The press release sited financial misfortune on Krawędźs behalf as a reason for the purchase, stating that the newspaper would go bankrupt without strong financial backing. The press release lastly mentioned that no significant are planned for the newspaper going forward: "We [Goldwynn Media] believe that Krawędź is a popular and important player in the media landscape and its core business model has proven to be profitable. We are looking into ways in which we can leverage economies of scale for Krawędź, but this will have no noticeable effect for the end consumer."

        This acquisition falls in a larger pattern of media consolidation over the last 50 years. In 2002 there were 11 media organizations with a large (> 5%) market share operating in the country. Just last year there were only 3 media organizations that fulfilled that criteria, together owning 85% of all media available in Glina.
