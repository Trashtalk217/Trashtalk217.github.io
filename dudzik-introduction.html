      <h2>A Word From Our New Editor:</h2>
      <h2>Jonathan Dudzik</h2>
      <p>
        [07-09-2019] It is a great honor to introduce myself as the next editor in chief for Krawędź. I'm highly aware that the role of editor is a significant responsibility and I'm thankful that I was entrusted with this position. I realize that it will be difficult to fill the gap left behind by predecessor, Daniel Szydł, who filled this role for more then a decade. But I trust that I can use my previous experience as editor for Metro to continue the mission that Daniel and the rest of the staff have been working hard for, every single day: Delivering quality and outspoken news to more then a million people. 
      </p>
      <p>
       I should make it clear that, for now, Krawędź will change very little, while I'm integrating into the company and learning of the people and its processes. But, we should also not dwell in the comfortable past when there are clever new ideas to be explored. One of the first changes you may notice this weekend, is the new look of our magazine Sobota. Which was given a modern look by our design department, an effort spearheaded by the wonderful Paula Zubał.

        The people, like Paula Zubał, are the reason that this newspaper not only exists, but has been ably to thrive for years and years. And I am very thankful to be part of a team, which can carry on that legacy for years more to come. With all that being said, there are only 300 words reserved for this opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's get to work!
