      <h2>Final Notice</h2>
      <p>
        [01-01-2020] We are sad to anounce that Krawędź, a newspaper always commited to providing a qualitative look on the complex and interconnected world we call home, is closing indefinitely. This is due to the internal restructering by our parent company Koncern Goldwynn Media, <a href="goldwynn-takeover.html">who recently aquired Krawędź.</a> The decision was made to focus more resources on other, more financially stable, tabloids and specialized magazines.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the admittendly <a href="dudzik-introduction.html">brief time</a> I've been the chief editor for Krawędź, I've come to know the team well. They were the heart and soul of this newspaper. They gave the plaque hanging prominently in the lobby its meaning: "Zawsze Dąż Do Prawdy." They made it more than just an empty slogan, devoid of substance. So I'd like to, for one last time, thank every editor, reporter, columnist, fotographer, graphic designer, administrative worker and every other person that helped create this newspaper.
      </p>
      <p>
        But perhaps most importantly, I must thank you, the reader, for supporting journalistic integrity for all these years. Because in the end, you made it all possible. And not only in a monetary sense, but also by sending in corrections or participating in our polls. Our <a href="water-quality-survey.html">collaborative journalism program</a> started by my predecessor was groundbreaking and it wouldn't have been possible without you. I know that I may speak for every employee of Krawędź when I say: Thank you.
