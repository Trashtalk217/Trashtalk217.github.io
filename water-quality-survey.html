      <h2>Water Quality In Large Parts Of Glina Below WHO Standards</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last six months we've been conducting, with the help of thousands of volunteers in our <a href="url">collaborative journalism program,</a> water quality tests all over the country. Now the program has truly come to an end, this article intends to publish the results and conclusions. This article is therefor no continuation to the <a href="url">Vrisna Chemical Dumping story</a>, which is still developing.
      </p>

        With portable water tests handed out to a selection of our subscribers, both drinking water and surface water was tested on poisonous substances. The testing results, combined with their location, were sent back by mail and compiled by our reporters and editors. Extra tests were also conducted by our Krawędź journalists to ensure a qualitative data set. The collected data was compiled and split in two distinct maps. These are shown below:

        As can be seen above, the tap water, especially in rural areas, contains a high (> 50 mg/l) concentration of nitrate, one of the chemicals tested for. Such a high concentration is linked to an increase risk for several types of cancer and the predominate cause of Blue Baby Syndrome: A condition that limits a baby&apos;s oxygen intake, resulting in suffocation. The WHO recommends caution for pregnant women and parents with babies in these areas, noting that, if available, bottled water often has a far lower nitrate concentration.

        The increase in nitrates is very likely caused by more modern industrial farming methods, professor in agricultural studies Estzer Alberti notes. She compared our results to similar research conducted in the United States, where an unregulated farming industry produces a lot of manure that brings nitrate into the groundwater. Estzer specifically points out a <a href="url">piece of legislation from 5 years ago</a> that eased restrictions regarding herd sizes.

        The Ministry of Health and Sports has not yet responded to our findings.

        The other chemical that was tested on was arsenic. Less of these tests were sent out since they are relatively more expensive and harder to operate. It won&apos;t be necessary to map out the reported cases, since none were found. Given that arsenic can be deadly at concentrations as small as 100 micrograms per liter.

        The last chemical tested on was lead, of particular interest due to the prevalence of lead tubing used in many older buildings. In this case we only asked our volunteers to test tap water, which produced the following result:

        As can be seen above, the older cities have a significant spike in lead concentration. Health experts recommenced that children should not be exposed to high amounts of lead, as it can hamper their mental development. Especially schools and daycares that are housed in older buildings ought to have their plumbing checked.
      </p>

        These were the results of a six month effort by volunteers, reporters and scientists to perform research the government <a href="url">hasn&apos;t done last year</a>. This article was merely an outline and the full scientific report is included with this edition of Krawędź. We want to thank everyone who participated and hope that our collective effort can create the change that this country deserves.
